# Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation in C++


## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of fundamental Machine Learning algorithms using C++. Specifically, it features the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and K-Means algorithms, providing a foundation for learning and experimentation in the field of machine learning.

## Setup
To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Mark the main directory as your project root by running the following command:
```shell
export MNIST_ML_ROOT=$PWD
```
3. Navigate to the respective algorithm directory (`KNN` or `KMEANS`) and build the executable using the provided Makefile.
4. Execute the main executable to run the algorithm on the MNIST dataset.

## Dataset
The algorithms are designed to work with the MNIST database of handwritten digits. For detailed information about the dataset, refer to the official [MNIST website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
